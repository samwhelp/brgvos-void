**BRGV-OS** is a custom [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/) based distribution that aims to facilitate developers, researchers and users to transitioning from Windows&#174; or MacOS&#174; to Linux&#174; by maintaining familiar operational habits and workflows.  
This work was do it for our job needs at Gene Bank research institute from Suceava, Romania, but anyone can use or modify for their needs.  
The name **BRGV** is an acronym from Romanian "**B**anca de **R**esurse **G**enetice **V**egetale" (shortly in English Gene Bank), and **OS** mean, of course, **O**perating **S**ystem.

**BRGV-OS** have now 10 themes, 2 for users what prefers classical style and 8 for the users what prefers Unix&#174; style, look at next movie:

For theme management I wrote the following extensions, scripts and menus:

* [Accent gtk theme](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/8497/accent-gtk-theme/), it is a `Gnome™` extension that changes the gtk app theme, based on the accent color chosen by the user in `Gnome Settings`, `Appearance screen` and by preferred `color schema`, `Light` or `Dark`, source code [here](https://github.com/florintanasa/accent-gtk-theme);
* [Accent icons theme](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/8499/accent-icons-theme/), it is a `Gnome™` extension that changes the icons themes, based on the `accent color` chosen by the user in `Gnome Settings` (gnome-control-center), `Appearance` screen and by preferred `color schema`, `Light` or `Dark`, source code [here](https://github.com/florintanasa/accent-icons-theme);
* [Accent user theme](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/8498/accent-user-theme/), it is a `Gnome™` extension that changes the user's theme based on the accent color chosen by the user in `Gnome Settings`, `Appearance` screen and by preferred `color schema`, `Light` or `Dark`, source code [here](https://github.com/florintanasa/accent-user-theme);
* [Light/Dark cursor theme](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/8496/lightdark-cursor-theme/), it is a `Gnome™` extension that changes the cursor themes, based on the preferred `color schema`, `Light` or `Dark`, source code [here](https://github.com/florintanasa/light-dark-cursor-theme);
* And 10 [scripts](https://github.com/florintanasa/brgvos-void/tree/main/includedir/usr/local/bin), these are called by 10 [menus](https://github.com/florintanasa/brgvos-void/tree/main/includedir/usr/local/share/applications).
  
Also **BRGV-OS** have another extension [Set Notification Banner Position](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/8495/set-notification-banner-position/), it is a `Gnome™` extension that changes the position of the banner notification on the sreen, source code [here](https://github.com/florintanasa/set-notification-position).

## How to build

It is suggested to use **Void Linux** or an others based on this distribution, also **BRGV-OS** work :)  
Default start the build for Romanian language, if you wish to build for international English USA language edit file `locale` and change from `ro_RO.UTF-8` to `en_US.UTF-8` and also edit file `keymap` and change from `ro` to `us`.  
That's it.  
If you wish to build for your language, take a look at file `build_brgvos.sh` how I do it from English USA language and Romanian language.
To build the iso image, it is necessary to use a based **Void Linux** distribution or **BRGV-OS** (is a spin **Void Linux**) where we run next commands:  

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/florintanasa/brgvos-void.git
cd brgvos-void
sudo ./build_brgvos.sh
```  
  
After that, if everything works ok, we find the iso image is in directory `iso build`.
