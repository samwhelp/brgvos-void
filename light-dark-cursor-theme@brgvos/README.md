# Light/Dark Cursor Theme
It is a Gnome extension that changes the cursor themes, based on the preferred color schema Light or Dark.  
The extension is a modification of the [Accent Color Icon Theme Changer For GNOME](https://github.com/taiwbi/gnome-accent-directories) extension, thank you `Mohammad Mahdi Tayebi` for your work.  
This extension is included in **BRGV-OS** Linux distribution.
